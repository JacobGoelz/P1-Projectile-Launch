# Project 1: 2D physics-Based Gameplay

By Curtis Clemmons.

## Instructions
Try and knock the target into the groove!
In order to change the strength in which the alien is launched use the up and down arrow keys.
The up arrow key will increase the strength by 25 and the down arrow key will decrease the
strength by 25. The default strength is set at 500. The strength is indicated by the length of the arrow.
In order to change the direction in which you fire the alien use the left and right arrow keys. The angle in which the alien will launch is indicated by the direction the line is pointing. 

## Project Report

Overall this assignment was fairly difficult, there were a few areas that I struggled to
figure out. In the end I wasn't able to get figure out how to display the angle in which 
the projectile would be launched. This is something, along with a few other things I would 
like to figure out for the next iteration. As of now this project showed me that I need to
mess around with the godot engine and learn more about.


Self-assessment:
 - [ ] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
 - [ ] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
 - [ ] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
 - [ ] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
 - [ ] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
 - [ ] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
 - [ ] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
 - [ ] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
 - [ ] C-6: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
 - [ ] C-7: The player can fire the projectile.
 - [ ] C-8: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
 - [ ] C-9: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
 - [ ] C-10: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
 - [ ] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
 - [ ] B-2: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
 - [ ] B-3: Once fired, the projectile is non-interactive.
 - [ ] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
 - [ ] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
 - [ ] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.
