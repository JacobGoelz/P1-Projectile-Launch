# Project 1: 2D physics-Based Gameplay

By Curtis Clemmons.

## Instructions
Try and knock the target into the groove!
In order to change the strength in which the alien is launch use the up and down arrow keys.
The up arrow key will increase the strength by 25 and the down arrow key will decrease the
strength by 25. The default strength is set at 500. 
In order to change the direction in which you fire the alien use the left and right arrow 
keys. The left arrow key will cause the alien to launched straighter in the air where as the
right arrow key will launch the alien further to the right. The Default angle is to 45 degrees.

## Project Report

Overall this assignment was fairly difficult, there were a few areas that I struggled to
figure out. In the end I wasn't able to get figure out how to display the angle in which 
the projectile would be launched. This is something, along with a few other things I would 
like to figure out for the next iteration. As of now this project showed me that I need to
mess around with the godot engine and learn more about.


Self-assessment:
All steps are completed up to the b level, therefore I fill this project deserves at least 
B.
